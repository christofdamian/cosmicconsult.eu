              Training like an Astronaut:<BR>
              ESA Space Training
            </H2>
            <P>
              Private customers, e.g. managers, space freaks, journalists and other interested people can experience authentic astronaut training at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne. 
			  They are trained by professional training personnel on real training facilities with original procedures. The training campaigns are performed under the responsibility of Klaus 
			  Damian, former Head of Astronauts Training Division of EAC. 
            </P>
            <P>
              The curriculum of typically 2 days spans from theoretical lectures to hands on training of space experiments on the European Laboratory Columbus or rendez-vous and docking 
			  of the European Transport Vehicle Jules Verne (ATV). Participants gain a first hand insider impression of the challenging and demanding profession of astronauts and their 
			  "ground personnel". Even weightlessness simulation by underwater training in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility of EAC can be undertaken subject to successful medical tests.
            </P>
            <P>
              The 2 days experience provides full immersion into a professional world, which is normally not accessible to outsiders, including informal communication and social 
			  interaction during breaks and during an informal dinner with space experts and, if available, also astronauts.

              A Space Visitor Centre
            </H2>
            <P>
              Cosmos Cologne <SUP>TM</SUP> is the project a common visitor centre of ESA and DLR in Cologne in response to the increasing flow of 
			  visitors coming daily to visit DLR institutes and the European Astronaut Centre attracted by the fascination of spaceflight. 
			  The flow of visitors breaks records every two years at the "Space Day" open door event of ESA and DLR, last time (2007) with more than
			  100000 visitors. 
            </P>

              The Mission of Cosmos Cologne <SUP>TM</SUP>: <center><h2>Discover the explorer within you!</h2></center>
            </P>
            <P>
              Exploration starts with curiosity. In Cosmos Cologne <SUP>TM</SUP> the visitors themselves become explorers. They embark on a 
			  journey in which they discover aeronautics and spaceflight. They explore the earth seen from space and they experience the 
			  dimensions of space travel on earth. Their curiosity, their urge to acquire knowledge and their imagination are the
              driving forces for an exciting passage through the fascinating subjects of air and space exploration.
            </P>
            <P>
              Cosmos Cologne <SUP>TM</SUP> will be an informative, educating and entertaining location, appealing to various senses and stimulating visitors to become interactive.
            </P>
            <P>
              Most important asset of Cosmos Cologne <SUP>TM</SUP> is the interrelation to the adjacent campus with DLR and EAC, which invite to visit their facilities and to meet scientists,
              engineers and astronauts at work.
